# Frontend Mentor - Launch countdown timer

![Design preview for the Launch countdown timer coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second
- Bonus: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## Lessons learnt

- üí° Ultimately I used two elements portioned one on top of the other, with one rotated to show it‚Äôs contents when the flip rotation took place. This sounds simple but I actually had to use bits of paper cut out to get my head around what was happening!


## Problems

- ‚ö†Ô∏è This approach seemed to use a lot of power on my poor little old MacBook Air. I suspect that a more performant approach might involve some state management via a framework
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The CSS isn't perfect for sure. I would have liked to make the numbers appear more like they belong to separate elements (which they do) but they still appear dumped on top. 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è I also felt like one of the numbers should be different. For example the flip card should be one number ahead of the numbers on the background. I tried a couple of combinations, but I couldn't get my head around this. 

## Future learning

- üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Keep playing around with transitions, transforms and animations!
